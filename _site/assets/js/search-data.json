The default block size of dd is 512 bytes, which is pretty small. Newer usb sticks have bigger block sizes, most will support something like 4 MB. This will increase the flash time. If the process fails you can always change it to a lower value or leave it completely empty. The small default value should work on any functional usb stick, but it might take a little bit longer to flash the image to the stick. ",
